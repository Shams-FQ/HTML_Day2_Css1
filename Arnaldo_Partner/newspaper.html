            In 1569, Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II purchased a large floodplain of the Wien river beneath a hill, situated between Meidling and Hietzing. The former owner, in 1548, had <br>erected a mansion called Katterburg. The emperor ordered the
            area to be fenced and put game there such as pheasants, ducks, deer and boar, in order for it to serve as the court's recreational <br> hunting ground. In a small separate part of the area, "exotic" birds such as turkeys and peafowl were kept.
            Fishponds were also built.
