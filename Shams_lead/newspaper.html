            This new IPCC report comes out at a time of great 
            turmoil, when we need strong multilateralism to promote peace and a healthy environment. And th<br>
            e message this report sends is clear. Climate change isn’t lurking around the corner, waiting to poun<br>
            ce. It’s already upon us, raining down blows on billions of people.

            ius of global warming. Even if we limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the blows wi<br>
            ll come harder and faster. As things stand, we are heading for closer to 3 degrees Celsius. We are in <br>
            an emergency, heading for a disaster.
            We can’t keep taking the hits and treating the wounds. Soo <br>
            n those wounds will be too deep, too catastrophic, to heal.
            We need to soften and slow the blows by cutting greenhouse<br>
            gas emissions. But we also need to cushion the blows by picking up ou
            r efforts to adapt to climate change – which have been too weak for too long.<br>

            We are seeing dangerous disruption across the 
            natural world. Species are migrating in search<br>
            of more liveable conditions. In climate risk ho
            tspots, deaths from floods, droughts and storms were 15<br>
            times higher than those in more resilient countries over the last decade. This is climate<br>
            injustice, particularly for indigenous peoples and local communities.<br>
            <br>

            All of this, and more, at only 1.1 degrees Cels
